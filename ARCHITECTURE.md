# ASHv2 Architecture

## Scope

This document describes the internal architecture of this crate as currently implemented.
The crate implements the host side of ASHv2 over caller-provided asynchronous byte streams.
The transport is commonly a serial link to an NCP, but the core architecture is independent of
how that stream is opened and configured.

## High-Level Runtime Structure

At runtime, the crate is centered around `start(...)`, which creates two asynchronous
actor futures:

- `Transmitter`: owns the supplied `AsyncWrite` implementation and connection state.
- `Receiver`: owns the supplied `AsyncRead` implementation and inbound frame handling.

`start(reader, writer, response)` takes transport halves that the caller has already opened,
configured, and split. It returns `Handle`, the user-facing send handle, and a `Futures`
container with transmitter and receiver futures that the caller must spawn or poll on their async
runtime. Incoming payloads are pushed to the user-provided response channel.

## Connection and Future Lifecycle

The transmitter is the owner of connection state (`Uninitialized`, `Connected`, `Failed`).
On startup it sends `RST`, waits for `RST-ACK`, and only then handles payload traffic normally.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Uninitialized
    Uninitialized --> Connected: valid RST-ACK (version=2, in time)
    Uninitialized --> Uninitialized: resend RST / keep payloads pending
    Connected --> Failed: I/O error or inbound RST/ERROR
    Failed --> Uninitialized: reset() sends RST
    Connected --> Connected: DATA/ACK/NAK exchange
```

## Message Flow

### Outbound path (App -> NCP)

1. App calls `Handle::send(payload).await`.
2. `Handle` sends `Message::Payload` into the transmitter queue with a oneshot response channel.
3. Transmitter creates a `DATA` frame:
   - sets frame number (`u8`, masked to 3 bits for modulo-8 behavior),
   - sets current ACK number,
   - masks payload bytes,
   - computes CRC.
4. Transmitter writes via write buffer:
   - convert frame to bytes,
   - stuff reserved control bytes,
   - append `FLAG (0x7E)`,
   - write to the caller-provided `AsyncWrite` implementation.
5. Transmitter stores transmission metadata for ACK/NAK-based completion/retransmission.

### Inbound path (NCP -> App)

1. The caller-provided `AsyncRead` implementation supplies inbound bytes.
2. The receiver buffer retains any unconsumed bytes between reads.
3. Receiver reads bytes until `FLAG`.
4. Receiver handles control bytes (`CANCEL`, `SUBSTITUTE`, `XON`, `XOFF`, `WAKE`) and un-stuffs payload bytes.
5. Parsed bytes are converted into a typed frame and CRC-validated.
6. Receiver behavior by frame type:
   - `DATA`: sequence check, send `ACK` or `NAK`, unmask payload, forward to response channel.
     Out-of-sequence retransmissions are duplicates: they are `ACK`ed but not forwarded again.
   - `ACK`: notify transmitter to retire sent frames up to ACK number.
   - `NAK`: notify transmitter to retransmit matching sent frame.
   - `RST`, `RST-ACK`, `ERROR`: forward to transmitter for connection-state handling.

    S->>R: inbound frame bytes
    R->>T: Message::ReceivedAck / ReceivedNak
    R->>Q: unmasked payload
    Q->>A: Payload
```

## Async I/O Path

The core API is generic over separate Tokio `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` implementations. It does
not depend on `serialport` or `async-serialport`, and does not open, configure, or split a serial
port. Those transport-specific operations belong to the calling application.

The receiver buffer reads chunks directly from the supplied reader and retains bytes after a
completed frame for the next read. The transmitter buffer writes fully encoded and stuffed frames
through the supplied writer.

## Optional EZSP Integration

The `ezsp` feature enables the public `ashv2::ezsp` module and its optional `ezsp` and
`le-stream` dependencies. It does not change the core transport or actor API.

- `ashv2::ezsp::Transmitter` aliases `Handle`, whose `ezsp::Transmit` implementation encodes typed
  EZSP headers and parameters into `Payload`.
- `ashv2::ezsp::Receiver` owns the response channel's receiver, decodes each inbound `Payload`
  into a typed EZSP frame, and implements `ezsp::Receive`. The EZSP layer passes its negotiated
  protocol version into each receive call.

```

## Termination Path

The actor does not use a terminate message. Each clone of the user-facing `Handle` keeps the
outbound message queue open. After every handle has been dropped, the queue closes. The
transmitter drains any messages already in the queue and then exits its main loop.

When the transmitter exits, it clears the shared running flag observed by the receiver, causing
the receiver to terminate. The caller must continue polling or awaiting both returned futures
during this process. Their transport halves are dropped when the futures complete; any additional
transport resource cleanup is the caller's responsibility.

```mermaid

    participant H as Handle clones

    A->>H: drop every handle
    H-->>Q: last sender dropped
    Q-->>T: queue drained and closed
    T->>T: exit transmit loop
    T-->>R: running = false
    R->>R: exit receive loop
```

## Frame Types and Purpose

| Frame | Header Pattern | Purpose | Key fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATA` | bit7 = 0 | Carry protocol payload data | frame number (3 bits), retransmit flag, ACK number (3 bits), payload, CRC |
| `ACK` | `0b1000_xxxx` with type bits for ACK | Positive acknowledgement of received data | ACK number, `nRDY`, CRC |
| `NAK` | `0b1010_xxxx` with type bits for NAK | Negative acknowledgement, requests retransmit | ACK number, `nRDY`, CRC |
| `RST` | `0xC0` | Request reset / restart link establishment | fixed header, CRC |
| `RST-ACK` | `0xC1` | Confirm reset and report reset reason/version | protocol version, reset code, CRC |
| `ERROR` | `0xC2` | Signal protocol/link error | protocol version, error code, CRC |

### DATA header bit layout

- bits `6..4`: frame number (`u8`, lower 3 significant bits)
- bit `3`: retransmit flag
- bits `2..0`: ACK number (`u8`, lower 3 significant bits)

### ACK/NAK header bit layout

- ACK base: `0b1000_0000`
- NAK base: `0b1010_0000`
- bit `3`: `nRDY`
- bits `2..0`: ACK number (`u8`, lower 3 significant bits)

## Reliability and Retransmission Model

- Sliding window capacity is `TX_K` (default `5`), stored in a fixed-capacity queue.
- Payload requests wait in a local, bounded pending queue (64 entries, oldest evicted with an
  error) while the link is down or the sliding window is full, and are sent in order as soon as
  the window frees up. The transmitter never sends into its own inbox, which would deadlock it.
- While payloads are pending, a 100 ms housekeeping tick keeps retrying the reset handshake and
  draining the pending queue. Link-control messages received while disconnected are dropped.
- Each queued transmission tracks:
  - send time (`Instant`),
  - frame number,
  - retransmit count.
- On inbound `ACK`, matching transmitted frames are retired.
- On inbound `NAK`, matching frame is removed and retransmitted with retransmit flag set.
- Transmissions not acknowledged within `T_RX_ACK_MAX` (measured from the latest
  (re-)transmission) are retransmitted with the retransmit flag set by the housekeeping tick.
- After too many retransmissions (`ACK_TIMEOUTS = 4` in current code), transmit returns timeout
  error and the connection is reset.

## CRC Validation

- CRC algorithm: `CRC-16-IBM-3740`.
- CRC is computed over frame bytes excluding the CRC field itself.
- Receiver validates CRC per frame type before semantic handling.
- Invalid CRC in inbound `DATA` triggers `NAK`; invalid control frames are ignored with warning logs.

## Randomization (Masking) in Detail

ASH payload randomization is implemented as XOR masking on payload bytes (not on headers/CRC):

- Generator state defaults:
  - seed: `0x42`
  - feedback mask: `0xB8`
  - flag bit: `0x01`
- For each generated mask byte:
  1. output current `random` value,
  2. shift `random` right by one,
  3. if previous output had flag bit set, XOR shifted value with `0xB8`.

Each payload byte is XORed with one generated mask byte.

Important properties:

- Symmetric transform: applying `mask()` twice restores original bytes.
- Used on send path before CRC computation for `DATA`.
- Used on receive path before delivering payload to the application.

## Byte Stuffing / Unstuffing in Detail

To preserve frame boundaries and control semantics on the serial stream, reserved bytes are escaped.

### Stuffing on transmit

Reserved bytes:

- `0x7D` (`ESCAPE`)
- `0x7E` (`FLAG`)
- `0x11` (`XON`)
- `0x13` (`XOFF`)
- `0x18` (`SUBSTITUTE`)
- `0x1A` (`CANCEL`)

For each reserved byte in frame content:

1. insert `ESCAPE (0x7D)` before it,
2. toggle bit 5 of original byte (`byte ^= 0x20`).

After stuffing all bytes, append final `FLAG (0x7E)` to terminate the frame.

### Unstuffing on receive

The receiver scans bytes until `FLAG`.

- On `ESCAPE`, it removes that byte and marks the next byte for de-escaping.
- The next byte is restored by toggling bit 5 (`byte ^= 0x20`).

Control-byte handling during stream parsing:

- `FLAG (0x7E)`: frame boundary.
- `CANCEL (0x1A)`: clear current buffer and error state.
- `SUBSTITUTE (0x18)`: set error condition; current frame is discarded on next `FLAG`.
- `XON/XOFF`: consumed as flow-control indications (not frame payload data).
- `WAKE (0xFF)`: treated as wake signal when buffer is empty.

## Configuration Knobs

Compile-time environment overridable constants:

- `ASHV2_MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE` (default `128`)
- `ASHV2_T_RSTACK_MAX_MILLIS` (default `3200`)
- `ASHV2_TX_K` (default `5`)
- `ASHV2_T_RX_ACK_MAX_MILLIS` (default `3200`)
