//! Asynchronous Serial Host version 2 (`ASHv2`)
//!
//! This library implements the Asynchronous Serial Host version 2, `ASHv2` for short.
//! It provides frame parsing and actor futures that manage the host-side link.
//!
//! # Transport API
//!
//! [`start`] accepts separate types implementing [`tokio::io::AsyncRead`] and
//! [`tokio::io::AsyncWrite`]. The caller opens, configures, and, when necessary, splits the
//! underlying transport before starting the actor futures. The core API has no dependency on
//! `serialport` or `async-serialport`.
//!
//! The returned [`Futures`] contains the transmitter and receiver futures. The caller must spawn
//! or otherwise poll both futures on an async runtime.
//!
//! # Termination
//!
//! The actor does not use a terminate message. Drop every clone of [`Handle`] to close the
//! outbound message queue. The transmitter drains queued messages and then terminates. It clears
//! the shared running state when it exits, which causes the receiver to terminate as well.
//! Continue polling or awaiting both actor futures until they complete.
//!
//! # EZSP integration
//!
//! The optional `ezsp` feature provides [`ezsp::Transmitter`] and [`ezsp::Receiver`] adapters.
//! [`ezsp::Transmitter`] is an alias for [`Handle`], which implements `ezsp::Transmit`.
//! [`ezsp::Receiver`] consumes the channel of inbound [`Payload`] values passed to [`start`] and
//! implements `ezsp::Receive`.
//!
//! You can find the protocol's definition on [siliconlabs.com](https://docs.silabs.com/zigbee/latest/uart-gateway-protocol-reference/).
//!
